Continue working on the task 1 (last slide) from the lecture slides for the unit 12. Implement the classes that you designed. Test your implementation from the main program by actually using your class objects. Showing that your implementation works correctly via testing will be graded with 30% of points for this homework. Upload two files: (a) one pdf file containing your class design and a short description of the problem and your solution, and (b) one py/ipynb file containing your implementation with all the classes and tests.
